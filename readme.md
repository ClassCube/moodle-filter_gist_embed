# Moodle Gist Embed Filter

Moodle filter plugin that will embed any links to GitHub gists with
the full JavaScript link so that it will embed.

This came about because, while it's easy enough to copy and paste the
JavaScript embed code from GitHub, Moodle strips out any JavaScript
markup. 

### Usage

After enabling the plugin just paste the full URL (https included) to a Gist into the
editor. When the page is displayed the link will be replaced with the embedded Gist.

### Settings

There really aren't any. Just paste in the link.
